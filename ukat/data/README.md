# General information about test data

This document contains two types of information:

1. Origin of test data
2. Information which is general enough to apply to all types of MR test data

Specific information for each type of MR data lives on the README.md files in each data subdirectory: [`b0`](b0/README.md), [`dwi`](dwi/README.md), [`r2star`](r2star/README.md).

## Origin of test data

With the exception of datasets marked with :star:, all test data is from the travelling kidney pilot study 2019.
