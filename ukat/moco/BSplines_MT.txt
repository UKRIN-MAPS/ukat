(Registration "MultiResolutionRegistration")
// Image intensities are sampled using an ImageSampler, Interpolator and ResampleInterpolator.
// Image sampler is responsible for selecting points in the image to sample. 
// The RandomCoordinate simply selects random positions. 
(ImageSampler "RandomCoordinate")
// Interpolator is responsible for interpolating off-grid posititions during optimization. 
// The BSplineInterpolator with BSplineInterpolationOrder = 1 used here is very fast and uses very little memory
(Interpolator "BSplineInterpolator")
// ResampleInterpolator here chosen to be FinalBSplineInterpolator with FinalBSplineInterpolationOrder = 1
// is used to resample the result image from the moving image once the final transformation has been found.
// This is a one-time step so the additional computational complexity is worth the trade-off for higher image quality.
(ResampleInterpolator "FinalBSplineInterpolator")
(Resampler "DefaultResampler")
// Order of B-Spline interpolation used during registration/optimisation.
// It may improve accuracy if you set this to 3. Never use 0.
// An order of 1 gives linear interpolation. This is in most 
// applications a good choice.
(BSplineInterpolationOrder 1)
// Order of B-Spline interpolation used for applying the final
// deformation.
// 3 gives good accuracy; recommended in most cases.
// 1 gives worse accuracy (linear interpolation)
// 0 gives worst accuracy, but is appropriate for binary images
// (masks, segmentations); equivalent to nearest neighbor interpolation.

// * Transformation
// *********************
// The control point spacing of the bspline transformation in

// such that the final grid spacing is obtained in the last
